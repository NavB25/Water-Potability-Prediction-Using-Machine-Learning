# Water-Potability-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

As populations across the globe continue to boom at record numbers, it is imperative that all nations have access to safe drinking-water. However, determining water potability to meet the standards of human consumption is not an easy task given the myriad of factors that contribute to the quality of water for safe consumption.

This is where the power of machine learning can come into play. This notebook explores the use of several classification algorithms to train machine learning models to accurately predict the potability of water samples based on a given set of features.
